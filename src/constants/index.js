export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a dedicated and versatile frontend developer with a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly web applications. With 4 years of professional experience, I have worked with a variety of technologies, including React.jS,HTML5,CSS3,Javascript, and Tailwind CSS. My journey in web development began with a deep curiosity for how things work, and it has evolved into a career where I continuously strive to learn and adapt to new challenges. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality solutions. Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source projects.

In addition to my core frontend expertise, I bring 3 years of solid experience in WordPress development. I’ve built dynamic websites using Elementor, WooCommerce, and the Astra theme, focusing on responsive design, performance optimization, and seamless user experience. I’m well-versed in:

Customizing WordPress themes and templates

Managing domains, hosting, and DNS configurations

SEO optimization using plugins like Yoast SEO

E-commerce setup with WooCommerce (payment gateways, product pages, cart/checkout flow)

Plugin management and conflict resolution

Creating landing pages and marketing funnels

Website speed optimization using caching and image compression tools

I’m always looking for innovative ways to bring ideas to life—whether through a custom-coded solution or a well-optimized WordPress setup`;
